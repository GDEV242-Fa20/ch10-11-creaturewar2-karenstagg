PROJECT TITLE:  Creature War

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This is a game of war between two Creature armies: 
the good army and the bad army.  The side with remaining combatants wins.
Creatures are randomly assigned a strength and hitpoints(health).
The good army consists of a given amout of Creature combatants made up of:
    * Humans - who have basic powers
    * Elves - which have additional magical potential
    * Hobbits - made up of MegaHobbits with absolute super power, 
                and SonicHobbits who have super power potential.
The bad army consists of a given amount of Creature combatants, made up of:
    * Humans -  who have basic powers
    * Demons - made up of CyberDemons with extreme magical demon power potential, 
               and Balrog, the ultimate demon who attacks twice during each battle 
               and also has the extreme magical demon power potential.

The war continues through a series of battles between the two armies.  The
strength and possible additional powers of each creature determine their strike 
affect on the opponent.  Attrition determines the winner of the war, and an 
action report at the end of the war sums up the reuslts of the war.

VERSION or DATE: November 09, 2020

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: The game of CreatureWar is started by creating a Creature
War object.  The constructor will then automatically populate the two armies, start
the war and carry out battles until a side has no combatants remaining.  The action
report will then automatically report the standings and winner.

AUTHORS: Karen Stagg

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Create a new CreatureWar object to play this game. Everything else
in the game happens automatically.
